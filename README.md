# Typing Ninja Extended 🥷⌨️🚀

This project is an enhanced version of the open-source [Typing Ninja](https://typing-ninja-two.vercel.app) typing speed testing web application.

It builds upon Typing Ninja’s minimalistic design and customization by adding:

* A **Document Manager** to add, import, and organize typing texts with titles and tags
* Persistent storage of documents and typing performance data in `localStorage`
* Ability to track and review typing progress per document
* Basic filtering and searching of documents by tags
* Integration-ready structure for practicing typing on user-managed documents
* Display progress as a percentage

## Original Tech Stack

* **Svelte 5 + SvelteKit** (Using `runes`)
* **TailwindCSS**

> *Note:* The extended version may use additional React components and localStorage management for document handling.

## Features (Extended)

* All original Typing Ninja features: accurate and comprehensive typing results, minimalist UI, customizable experience
* Document management system with tagging and filtering
* Persistent saving of documents and revision statistics
* User-friendly interface for managing multiple practice texts
* Designed to be modular and extensible
